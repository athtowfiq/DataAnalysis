# World Population Data Analysis
The data used to analyse population was collected from https://worldpopulationreview.com. I did necessary queries and analysis in the SQL Server. After gathering necessary information did some data cleaning using Power Bi and made a simple dashboard to show the estimated summary. 

## Technology and tools this analysis covered:

1. SQL Server
2. DAX
3. Microsoft Power Bi
4. Dashboard Optimization
